    <p>I am currently experiencing <strong>burnout</strong>. Life has been tough. Sometimes I feel so lost and alone and like a failure for not accomplishing anything and being afraid of even the smallest things. But now I'm trying to list some things here that can keep me going.</p>

    <h2>Things I am thankful for</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I have supportive parents who don't push me to get a job (mostly), and are very encouraging and comforting when I'm down.
      </li>
      <li>
        My sister is very sweet, understanding and encouraging to me, and replies to me no matter how tired she is. She reminds me how much I am worthy and loved. We are very far apart, but very close.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a wonderful loving boyfriend üíï who cherishes me and is steadfastly there for me, holding me, lifting me up, and never giving up on me.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have God, and God has been so kind and loving in sending so many people to bless me. He gives me faith to trust in Him when I can't, and stops me from doing dangerous things to myself.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have more friends than I expected, who reached out even when I isolated myself. Sure, some friends didn't, but there are those who stayed and walked with me - Yunci, Rach, Royce, Kelly, Qimin, Qian, Jiaks, Yvonne, Connect folks.. The list goes on.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have sufficient savings so I don't actually need to worry about money (but I do) and I don't need to pay rent or have any financial burdens.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am trying my best, even if it doesn't look like much. But I am still trying, and that is in itself something good.
      </li>
    </ol>
