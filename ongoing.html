    <h1>What I have been up to</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trying to be kind and patient to myself and not give myself deadlines or impose productivity expectations on myself and guilt trip myself
      </li>
      <li>
        Learning to do basic HTML (just finished my first module!) and hopefully other web development things <em>for fun</em>, not for the sake of any career planning or productive use
      </li>
      <li>
        Finished a UI/UX fundamentals course on Udemy despite my procrastination and stress yay
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooked a few times - pasta, egg drop soup, adobo fried rice (failed) - practising basic kitchen things
      </li>
      <li>
        Went cycling alone and also exercised from time to time (not enough, but I am trying)
      </li>
      <li>
        Spending time with friends and loved ones, trying to open myself up again and share honestly with others how I really am (even to my closest ones)
      </li>
      <li>
        Visited NL and had many adventures with my sis and alone too
      </li>
      <li>
        Conquering my fears and learning to live with my anxiety, sleeplessness, chest pains etc. daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Started colouring and found out I'm not the best at picking colours that go together heh but focusing on colouring and being quiet
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of different books and being inspired
      </li>
      <li>
        Playing choir songs again and savouring the experience for the last time
      </li>
      <li>
        Distracting myself with my favourite mobile game and shows e.g.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/81518991">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>

      </li>
      <li>
        Tried to do some schema therapy with a workbook and realised in the end it's down to practice - but I haven't started..
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying to stop tracking my expenditure so tightly to stop stressing myself out (not sure it is working)
      </li>
      <li>
        Having more realisations about myself - like how I do pack my schedule to avoid thinking so much, and how I'm still bottling up my thoughts. But it's time to face them.
      </li>
    </ul>
